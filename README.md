# Breath before speaking: a push protocol for rumor spreading with noise


## Synopsis
This repository contains the source code of an implementation for the Breath Before Speaking algorithm described in [https://doi.org/10.1007/s00446-015-0249-4](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00446-015-0249-4).

## Code structure
The code is mainly divided in two fundamental function: breath_stage1 and breath_stage2. These functions implement the corresponding stages indicated in [1]. 
 
To execute the protocol, the code relies on Flask,([https://www.palletsprojects.com/p/flask)](https://www.palletsprojects.com/p/flask/) 


## Usage
You can try 

## API
You try this protocol through the this API [http://artas.pythonanywhere.com/?n=1&p=1](http://artas.pythonanywhere.com/?n=1&p=1),
where you have to insert the n and p values for nodes e edge probability thath you prefer.
